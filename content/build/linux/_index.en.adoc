== Building KiCad on Linux

To perform a full build on Linux, run the following commands:

[source,sh]
```
cd <your kicad source mirror>
mkdir -p build/release
mkdir build/debug               # Optional for debug build.
cd build/release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        ../../
make
sudo make install
```

If the CMake configuration fails, determine the missing dependencies and install them on your
system.  By default, CMake sets the install path on Linux to /usr/local.  Use the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option to specify a different install path.
