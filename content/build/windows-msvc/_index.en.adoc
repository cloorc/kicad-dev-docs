== Building using Visual Studio (2019, 2022)

=== Environment Setup

==== Visual Studio
You must first install https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/[Visual Studio] with the **Desktop development with {cpp}** feature set installed.
Additionally, you'll need to make sure the optional component https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-160#installation[{cpp} CMake tools for Windows] is installed.

==== vcpkg

KiCad uses vcpkg for dependencies and uses *manifest mode* to declare the dependencies and our kicad registry on top of vcpkg.

Obtain vcpkg for your system from https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
or 
[source,powershell]
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

NOTE: KiCad requires a vcpkg.exe tool released since Jan 2022, therefore ensure any existing copy of vcpkg is up to date and bootstrap it again if required.

=== KiCad Specific Setup

==== 1. CMakeSettings.json
Contained in the build root is a `CMakeSettings.json.sample`, copy and rename this file to `CMakeSettings.json`
Edit `CMakeSettings.json` update the VcPkgDir environment variable up top to match the location of your vcpkg clone.

[source,json]

{ "VcPkgDir": "D:/vcpkg/" },

==== 2. "Open Folder" in Visual Studio
* Launch Visual Studio (only after completing the above steps).
* When the initial wizard launches, select to **Open a local folder**. 
This is the correct way to make Visual Studio directly handle *CMake* projects.
* Select the build root folder.
* Wait until the "CMake in Visual Studio" tab appears and the CMake process hits an error, which we'll fix in the next step.

==== 3. Configure paths to SWIG

SWIG must be installed manually.  Obtain the latest `swigwin` package from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/ (at the time of this writing, the latest is
`swigwin-4.0.2`) and extract the zip file to a known location.

At present, you must add CMake arguments SWIG
that you downloaded in a previous step.  Choose the Configuration you want to use (e.g. x64-Debug) in the toolbar. Then, open the CMake Settings editor (Project menu > CMake
Settings), and add the following items to the CMake Command Arguments option field:

`-DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=C:\\PATH\\TO\\swigwin-4.0.2\\swig.exe`

Replace the `PATH\\TO\\` section with the appropriate paths to SWIG on your
installation.  Make sure to change single backslashes to double backslashes if you are pasting in
a path from Windows Explorer.

Save the changes. CMake configuration should now succeed, showing "CMake generation finished" in the output window at the bottom.  You can now build! (Build menu > Build all)

==== 4. Running and debugging

Running or debugging KiCad directly from the build directory through Visual Studio requires that
you set certain environment variables so that KiCad can find runtime dependencies and Python works.
To configure the runtime environment for programs run from Visual Studio, edit the `launch.vs.json`
file in the project root directory.  To open this file, select Debug and Launch Settings for kicad
from the Debug menu.

NOTE: If you have multiple launch configurations, for example to debug standalone pcbnew or
      eeschema in addition to kicad, you will need to configure each one separately.

The variable `KICAD_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIR` must be present (it can be set to any value) to run from
the build directory. Setting this variable allows KiCad to find dynamic libraries when running from
the build directory.

The variable `KICAD_USE_EXTERNAL_PYTHONHOME` must be present (it can be set to any value) when
running from either the build or the install directory, which allows you to specify `PYTHONHOME` in
the environment.  Normally, KiCad on Windows uses a Python that is bundled and placed in a specific
location by the installer, and when running from Visual Studio, Python will be in a different
location.

The variable `PYTHONHOME` must be present and set to the location of the Python installed by vcpkg.

The variable `PYTHONPATH` must be present and set to include the paths to the `pcbnew` python
module and the `kicad_pyshell` module.  The former is built next to `pcbnew.exe` in the build
directory, and the latter lives in the source tree in the `scripting` directory.

Use the `env` section of each configuration entry to set the required environment variables. For
example, the below configuration allows running and debugging `kicad.exe` from the build directory,
assuming `vcpkg` is installed at `C:\code\vcpkg`.

Additionally, use the `environment` section to add the path to the `vcpkg` installed packages
directory, which will allow KiCad to find dynamic libraries from dependencies.


Create this file as <kicad_source>/.vs/launch.vs.json to have a baseline/working default launch configuration

=== Visual Studio Extensions

==== Trailing Whitespace Remover
It is *highly recommended* users install the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TrailingWhitespaceVisualizer[Trailing Whitespace Visualizer] (edition for Visual Studio 2022 link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TrailingWhitespace64[here]) which will not only highlight trailing whitespace as you type but also automatically remove it by default when you save the file.

=== Additional Notes

==== vcpkg binary caching
By default vcpkg will bundle up each dependency and store it in a *binary cache* which maintains copies of all past built dependencies by version.

The binary cache is located usually in %LOCALAPPDATA%\vcpkg\archives

If storage space consumed is a problem.

You may change the location of the binary cache by setting the environment variable `VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE` to a different path.

or

You may disable binary caching by setting the environment variable `VCPKG_FEATURE_FLAGS` with value `-binarycaching`. This is not advisable as the intention of the cache is to avoid rebuilds if the application cmake cache is destroyed and rebuilt and rebuilding kicad dependencies is quite time consuming.


=== Troubleshooting

==== vcpkg cannot finish installing a dependency

Antivirus software is known to block interim steps in the package build process. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus or adding an exception.

==== Error: Couldn't find the versions database file

If this occurs, a mismatch between vcpkg and registries occurred when it was checking your already installed libraries within the kicad build repo.
The easiest fix is to simply `Delete Cache and Reconfigure` under the Project menu option
