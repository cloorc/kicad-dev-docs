== Building using Visual Studio (2019)

=== Environment Setup

==== Visual Studio
You must first install https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/[Visual Studio] with the **Desktop development with {cpp}** feature set installed.
Additionally, you'll need to make sure the optional component https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-160#installation[{cpp} CMake tools for Windows] is installed.

==== vcpkg (kicad fork required)

KiCad maintains a fork of vcpkg to provide us with a wxPython port. 
It also allows us to lock our dependencies as vcpkg updates fairly frequently.

**If you are new to vcpkg** you must, pick a spot on your system to put it.
Then run these three commands

[source,powershell]
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/packaging/vcpkg
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg\vcpkg integrate install
```

which will give you a vcpkg install ready to use with the next steps

=== KiCad Specific Setup

vcpkg defaults to x86-windows even on 64-bit machines,
it is advised for ease of use you set a **USER** or **SYSTEM** environment variable
with the name **VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET** and value **x64-windows**

KiCad still supports 32-bit builds for now but may not in the future, thus 64-bit is preferred.

==== 1. Install dependencies
Most of KiCad's dependencies can be installed using `vcpkg` as described below:

[source,powershell]
```
.\vcpkg install boost
.\vcpkg install cairo
.\vcpkg install curl
.\vcpkg install glew
.\vcpkg install gettext
.\vcpkg install glm
.\vcpkg install icu
.\vcpkg install libxslt
.\vcpkg install ngspice
.\vcpkg install opencascade
.\vcpkg install opengl
.\vcpkg install openssl
.\vcpkg install python3
.\vcpkg install wxpython
.\vcpkg install wxwidgets
.\vcpkg install zlib
```

If you did not set the **VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET** environment variable, you will have to append
:x64-windows to end of each packages name, `boost:x64-windows` for example.

NOTE: If the vcpkg install fails on wxpython, you did not clone and checkout the `kicad` branch from https://gitlab.com/kicad/packaging/vcpkg for vcpkg

Additionally, SWIG must be installed manually.  Obtain the latest `swigwin` package from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/ (at the time of this writing, the latest is
`swigwin-4.0.2`) and extract the zip file to a known location.

==== 2. CMakeSettings.json
Contained in the build root is a `CMakeSettings.json.sample`, copy and rename this file to `CMakeSettings.json`
Edit `CMakeSettings.json` update the VcPkgDir environment variable up top to match the location of your vcpkg clone.

[source,json]
----
{ "VcPkgDir": "D:/vcpkg/" },
----

==== 3. "Open Folder" in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio (only after completing the above steps).

When the initial wizard launches, select to **Open a local folder**
This is the correct way to make Visual Studio directly handle *CMake* projects.

==== 4. Configure paths to Python and SWIG

At present, you must add CMake arguments to the location of Python installed by `vcpkg` and SWIG
that you downloaded in a previous step.  Open the CMake Settings editor (Project menu > CMake
Settings for kicad) and add the following items to the CMake Command Arguments option field:

`-DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=C:\\PATH\\TO\\swigwin-4.0.2\\swig.exe -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=C:\\PATH\\TO\\vcpkg\\installed\\x64-windows\\tools\\python3\\python.exe`

Replace the `PATH\\TO\\` section with the appropriate paths to Python and SWIG on your 
installation.  Make sure to change single backslashes to double backslashes if you are pasting in
a path from Windows Explorer.

=== Visual Studio Extensions

==== Trailing Whitespace Remover
It is *highly recommended* users install the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TrailingWhitespaceVisualizer[Trailing Whitespace Visualizer] which will not only highlight trailing whitespace as you type but also automatically remove it by default when you save the file.
