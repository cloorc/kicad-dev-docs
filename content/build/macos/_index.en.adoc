== Building KiCad on macOS

Building on macOS requires care, as specific versions of dependencies are required in order for all
KiCad features to compile and work properly. To simplify this process, we strongly recommend that
all macOS users use our https://gitlab.com/kicad/packaging/kicad-mac-builder[kicad-mac-builder]
utility, which contains the toolchain that produces the official macOS release builds of KiCad.

This utility can be used to set up a development environment for KiCad even if you just wish to
build the sources without creating a full release package (DMG containing the KiCad applications 
and libraries).

Building without `kicad-mac-builder` is possible but is not supported by the KiCad development
team. If you wish to pursue this route, please use the latest state of the kicad-mac-builder
repository for guidance as to which packages to install and how to configure and build them.

NOTE: KiCad requires a custom fork of wxWidgets on macOS to work properly. This fork is hosted at
      https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/wxWidgets[the KiCad GitLab].  Currently, the
      `kicad/macos-wx-3.2` branch should be used to build the master branch of KiCad.  If you use
      `kicad-mac-builder` to set up your build environment, the correct version of wxWidgets will
      be downloaded and built for you automatically.

=== Prerequisites

As of version 7, KiCad requires macOS 11 or higher to build (the build outputs can be run on some
older verisons of macOS).  KiCad supports Apple's arm64 architecture as well as x86_64, and the
packaging scripts can produce a "universal binary" that will run on either architecture.  You must
take care to maintain a consistent architecture when building on arm64, which `kicad-mac-builder`
will try to ensure for you.  Building some of the dependencies for `arm64` and some for `x86_64`
will result in linker errors (or Python errors) later in the process.

=== Setting up development environment using kicad-mac-builder

This guide assumes you already have the appropriate Apple C++ development toolchain (Xcode) for
your macOS release installed.  See Apple's documentation for details on how to install Xcode or the
Xcode command-line tools.  `kicad-mac-builder` will not install this for you.

To obtain `kicad-mac-builder` and set up the KiCad build dependencies, run the following on an
Apple arm64 machine:

[source,sh]
```
cd <your preferred working directory>
git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/packaging/kicad-mac-builder.git
cd kicad-mac-builder
./ci/arm64-on-arm64/bootstrap.sh
WX_SKIP_DOXYGEN_VERSION_CHECK=1 ./build.py --arch arm64 --target setup-kicad-dependencies
```

Or, on an x86_64 (Intel) machine:

[source,sh]
```
cd <your preferred working directory>
git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/packaging/kicad-mac-builder.git
cd kicad-mac-builder
./ci/x86_64-on-x86_64/bootstrap.sh
WX_SKIP_DOXYGEN_VERSION_CHECK=1 ./build.py --arch x86_64 --target setup-kicad-dependencies
```

NOTE: The first command, `boostrap.sh`, will install Homebrew if it is not already installed, and
      install all the KiCad dependencies that are available as Homebrew packages.  You may wish to
      manually install the required dependencies instead of running this script.  If so, simply
      inspect the script to see the current list of required Homebrew packages to install.  The
      example bootstrap scripts are used for native compilation on the two Apple architectures.
      There is also an `x86_64-on-arm64` option that can be used for cross-compilation on arm64
      machines.

WARNING: The bootstrapping scripts are designed to run in a "clean" installation of macOS on our CI
         build machines.  If you already have Homebrew installed to a non-standard directory, do
         not run `bootstrap.sh`.  Instead, inspect the script and adapt the commands in it to your
         environment.  If you already have Python installed, especially if you use a tool like
         `pyenv` to manage Python versions, you must ensure that the `python3` that is found first
         on your `PATH` matches the target architecture you are building KiCad for.

At the end of the `kicad-mac-builder` build process, `build.py` will print a list of suggested
CMake arguments to the terminal.  **Copy this output to a safe place: you will need to refer to it
when you set up your KiCad build.**

=== Building KiCad

Now you are ready to build KiCad itself.  Run the following to obtain and build KiCad:

[source,sh]
```
cd <your preferred working directory>
git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad.git
cd kicad
mkdir -p build/release
mkdir build/debug               # Optional for debug build.
cd build/release
cmake <arguments from kicad-mac-builder> ../..
make
make install
```

Paste in the arguments you saved from earlier after the `cmake` command.  Note that you may want to
inspect and modify some of the arguments before using them:

By default, `kicad-mac-builder` will set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `./build/kicad-dest` inside
your `kicad-mac-builder` directory.  Edit the arguments provided by `kicad-mac-builder` if you want
to install KiCad to a different location.

By default, `kicad-mac-builder` will set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `RelWithDebInfo` to create an 
optimized release build with debugging symbols.  Change this to `Debug` to create an unoptimized
build that can be debugged using `lldb`.

NOTE: We recommend using Ninja instead of `make` for faster builds.  To do so, run
      `brew install ninja` and then add `-G Ninja` to your `cmake` arguments.

=== Running and debugging

On macOS, it is not currently possible to run the build outputs from the build directory as can be
done on other platforms.  You must run `make install` (or `ninja install`) to package a complete
`KiCad.app` and then launch that.  You can use `lldb` to debug the application, or attach to a
running copy.

The installed package will be self-signed by the installation process.  This will allow it to run
on the local machine, but this package cannot be distributed to other machines without triggering
Apple's security measures.

=== Updating dependencies

At the moment, `kicad-mac-builder` is designed to run in a "clean-slate" environment and does not
automatically handle dependency updates.  From time to time, you may wish to update your KiCad
build dependencies.  To do so:

1) Run `git pull` inside your `kicad-mac-builder` folder to sync with KiCad upstream.
2) Delete the contents of the `./build` directory.
3) Re-run the `setup-kicad-dependencies` step as described above.

NOTE: It is possible to rebuild only certain dependencies by deleting certain folders inside the
      `./build` directory, however this is an advanced usage and will not be documented here.
      Inspect the `cmake` files inside the `kicad-mac-builder` subdirectory to figure out what to
      do.
