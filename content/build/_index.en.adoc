== 1. Building KiCad from Source
If you are a user and not a developer, please consider using one of the prebuilt packages
of KiCad which can be found at the https://kicad.org/download/[download] page on the https://kicad.org/[KiCad website].  Building KiCad
from source is not for the faint of heart and is not recommended unless you have reasonable
software development experience.  This document contains the instructions on how to build KiCad
from source on the supported platforms.  It is not intended as a guide for installing or building
[library dependencies](#library_dependencies).  Please consult your platforms documentation for
installing packages or the source code when building the library dependencies.  Currently the
supported platforms are Windows Versions 7-10, just about any version of Linux, and macOS
10.9-10.13.  You may be able to build KiCad on other platforms but it is not supported.  On
Windows and Linux the https://gcc.gnu.org/[GNU GCC] is the only supported compiler and on macOS http://clang.llvm.org/[Clang] is the
only supported compiler.
