summary: Summary of CMake build configuration options.
---

These are the build options that can be passed to CMake during configuration.

== All Platforms


[cols="4,12,1",options="header"]
|===

|Option
|Description
|Default

|KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON
|Build wxPython implementation for wx interface building in Python and py.shell.
|ON

|KICAD_INSTALL_DEMOS
|Install KiCad demos and examples.
|ON

|KICAD_BUILD_QA_TESTS
|Build software Quality assurance unit tests.
|ON

|KICAD_SPICE
|Build KiCad with internal Spice simulator.
|ON

|KICAD_BUILD_I18N
|Build the translation language libraries
|OFF

|KICAD_I18N_UNIX_STRICT_PATH
|Install the language libraries to the standard UNIX install path of
 ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/locale
|OFF
|
BUILD_SMALL_DEBUG_FILES
|In debug build: create smaller binaries.  On Windows, binaries created by link option -g3 are
 *very large* (more than 1Gb for Pcbnew, and more than 3Gb for the full KiCad suite).  This
 option create binaries using link option -g1 that create much smaller files, but  there are
 less info in debug (However the file names and line numbers are available).
|OFF

|MAINTAIN_PNGS
|Allow build/rebuild bitmap icons used in menus from the corresponding .svg file.  Set to
 true if you are a PNG maintainer and have the required tools given  in the
 bitmaps_png/CMakeLists.txt file.
|OFF

|KICAD_IPC_API
|Build KiCad with support for the IPC API server (requires the `nng` library)
|ON

|===

|KICAD_WIN32_DPI_AWARE
|Turn on DPI awareness for Windows builds only.
|OFF

|KICAD_WIN32_CONTEXT_WINFIBER
|Use win32 fibers for libcontext.
|OFF

|KICAD_USE_EGL
|Build KiCad with EGL backend support for Wayland.
|OFF

|KICAD_USE_BUNDLED_GLEW

|Build KiCad with valgrind stack tracking enabled.
|OFF

== Notes

=== Note 1

Python 3 is required to build KiCad.  The path to Python is normally determined automatically by a
CMake script, but if needed, `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` can be defined when invoking cmake
( use `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=<python path>` ) to specify a particular Python binary.

=== Note 2

These Symbols are always defined, and are not an option for cmake invocation:


*COMPILING_DLL*

This is a signal to import_export.h, and when present, toggles the
interpretation of the #defines in that file. Its purpose should not be
extended beyond this.


*USE_KIWAY_DLLS*

Comes from CMake as a user configuration variable, settable in the Cmake
user interface. It decides if KiCad will be built with the *.kiface program
modules.


*BUILD_KIWAY_DLL*

Comes from CMake, but at the 2nd tier, not the top tier. By 2nd tier,
something like pcbnew/CMakeLists.txt, not /CMakeLists.txt is meant. It is
not a user configuration variable. Instead, the 2nd tier CMakeLists.txt file
looks at the top level `USE_KIWAY_DLLS` and decides how the object files under
the 2nd tier's control will be built. If it decides it wants to march in
lockstep with `USE_KIWAY_DLLS`, then this local CMakeLists.txt file may pass a
defined `BUILD_KIWAY_DLL` (singular) on the compiler command line to the
pertinent set of compilation steps under its control.

=== Note 3

When building with `KICAD_BUILD_I18N` on Linux systems, gettext needs the rule files
`shared-mime-info.its` and `metainfo.its`/`appdata.its` to translate the Linux
metadata files.
