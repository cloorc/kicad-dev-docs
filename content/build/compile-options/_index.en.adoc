== Notes
When option `KICAD_SCRIPTING` OR `KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES` is enabled:

`PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` can be defined when invoking cmake
( use `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=<python path>/python.exe` or python2 )
when not defined by user, the Default is python.exe under Windows and python2 for others
python binary file should be in exec path.

=== Note 1

KICAD_SCRIPTING controls the entire python scripting system.
If it is off, no other scripting is allowed

Therefore, if `KICAD_SCRIPTING` is OFF, these other option are forced to OFF:
`KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES, KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU,KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3
KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON, KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX`

=== Note 2

`KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX` requires enabling the `KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON` flag
so that the wxWidgets library is properly versioned


=== Note 3

These Symbols are always defined, and are not an option for cmake invocation:


*COMPILING_DLL*

This is a signal to import_export.h, and when present, toggles the
interpretation of the #defines in that file. Its purpose should not be
extended beyond this.


*USE_KIWAY_DLLS*

Comes from CMake as a user configuration variable, settable in the Cmake
user interface. It decides if KiCad will be built with the *.kiface program
modules.


*BUILD_KIWAY_DLL*

Comes from CMake, but at the 2nd tier, not the top tier. By 2nd tier,
something like pcbnew/CMakeLists.txt, not /CMakeLists.txt is meant. It is
not a user configuration variable. Instead, the 2nd tier CMakeLists.txt file
looks at the top level `USE_KIWAY_DLLS` and decides how the object files under
the 2nd tier's control will be built. If it decides it wants to march in
lockstep with `USE_KIWAY_DLLS`, then this local CMakeLists.txt file may pass a
defined `BUILD_KIWAY_DLL` (singular) on the compiler command line to the
pertinent set of compilation steps under its control.
