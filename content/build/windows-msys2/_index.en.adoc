== Building using MSYS2

WARNING: MSYS2 is the legacy build system for Windows due to KiCad's historical roots. 
KiCad has switched to MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio) from version 6.0 and onwards for development and releases.
Building via MSYS2 is still possible but does not receive a high level of attention.

=== Setup

The https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2] project provides packages for all of the require dependencies to build KiCad.
To setup the MSYS2
build environment, download and run  the *MSYS2 64-bit Installer* available from the msys2 home page.
After the installer is finished, update to the latest
package versions by running the `msys2_shell.cmd` file located in the MSYS2 install path and
running the command `pacman -Syu`.  If the msys2-runtime package is updated, close the shell
and run `msys2_shell.cmd`.

=== Building
The following commands assume you are building for 64-bit Windows, and that you already have
the KiCad source code in a folder called `kicad-source` in your home directory.  See below
for changes if you need to build for 32-bit instead.  Run `mingw64.exe` from the MSYS2
install path. At the command prompt run the the following commands:

[source,bash]

          git \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-doxygen \

cd build/release

make -j N install   # Where N is the number of concurrent threads that your system can handle.

For 32-bit builds, run `mingw32.exe` and change `x86_64` to `i686` in the package names and
change the paths in the cmake configuration from `/mingw64` to `/mingw32`.

NOTE: msys2 has deprecated 32-bit support due to cygwin, it's upstream dependency eliminating 32-bit support.

For debug builds, run the cmake command with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` from the `build/debug`
folder.

=== MSYS2 with CLion
KiCad in combiation with MSYS2 can be configured to be used with CLion to provide a nice
IDE experience.

==== Toolchain Setup
First you must register MSYS2 as a toolchain, or namely, the compiler.

File > Preferences to open the Settings window.

Navigate to Build, Execution, Development and then the Toolchains page.

Add a new toolchain, and configure it as such

* Name: `MSYS2-MinGW64`
* Environment Path: `<your msys2 install folder>\mingw64\`
* CMake: `<your msys2 install folder>\mingw64\bin\cmake.exe`

All other fields will become automatically populated.


==== Project Setup
File > Open and select the folder containing the kicad source.
CLion may attempt to start CMake generation and fail, this is ok.

Open the Settings window again.
Navigate to Build, Execution, Development and then the CMake page.
These settings are saved to the project.

You want to create a Debug configuration as such

* Name: `Debug-MSYS2`
* Build-Type: `Debug`
* Toolchain: `MSYS2-MinGW64`
* CMake options:
```sh
-G "MinGW Makefiles"
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/mingw64
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw64
-DDEFAULT_INSTALL_PATH=/mingw64
```
* Build-directory: `build/debug-msys2`


You may now trigger the "Reload CMake Cache" option in CLion to generate the cmake project
You should delete the "junk" build folder (usually name cmake-build-debug-xxxx) it may have
created in the source before it was changed above.  We change the build folder because we
have a gitignore for `/build`

Warning: Receiving warning messages about Boost versions is normal.


=== Known MSYS2 Build Issues

There are some known issues that are specific to MSYS2.  This section provides a list of the
currently known issues when building KiCad using MSYS2.

==== wxwidgets 3.1
You get an error that wxwidgets 3.1 is not found

```
pacman -R mingw-w64-x86_64-wxwidgets
rm -rf build/release    # change to your cmake cache folder
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-wxmsw3.1
```
