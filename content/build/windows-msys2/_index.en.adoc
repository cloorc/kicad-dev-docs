== Building using MSYS2

=== Setup

The https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2] project provides packages for all of the require dependencies to build KiCad. 
To setup the MSYS2
build environment, depending on your system download and run either the [MSYS2 32-bit Installer][]
or the [MSYS2 64-bit Installer].  After the installer is finished, update to the latest
package versions by running the `msys2_shell.cmd` file located in the MSYS2 install path and
running the command `pacman -Syu`.  If the msys2-runtime package is updated, close the shell
and run `msys2_shell.cmd`.

=== Building
The following commands assume you are building for 64-bit Windows, and that you already have
the KiCad source code in a folder called `kicad-source` in your home directory.  See below
for changes if you need to build for 32-bit instead.  Run `mingw64.exe` from the MSYS2
install path. At the command prompt run the the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
    pacman -S base-devel \
              git \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-doxygen \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-python2 \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-swig \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-boost \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-glew \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-curl \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-wxPython \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-wxWidgets \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-glm \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-oce \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-ngspice \
              mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib
    cd kicad-source
    mkdir -p build/release
    mkdir build/debug               # Optional for debug build.
    cd build/release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
          -G "MSYS Makefiles" \
          -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/mingw64 \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw64 \
          -DDEFAULT_INSTALL_PATH=/mingw64 \
          ../../
    make -j N install   # Where N is the number of concurrent threads that your system can handle
----

For 32-bit builds, run `mingw32.exe` and change `x86_64` to `i686` in the package names and
change the paths in the cmake configuration from `/mingw64` to `/mingw32`.

For debug builds, run the cmake command with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` from the `build/debug` folder.

=== MSYS2 with CLion
KiCad in combiation with MSYS2 can be configured to be used with CLion to provide a nice IDE experience.

==== Toolchain Setup
First you must register MSYS2 as a toolchain, or namely, the compiler.

File > Preferences to open the Settings window.

Navigate to Build, Execution, Development and then the Toolchains page.

Add a new toolchain, and configure it as such

* Name: `MSYS2-MinGW64`
* Environment Path: `<your msys2 install folder>\mingw64\`
* CMake: `<your msys2 install folder>\mingw64\bin\cmake.exe`

All other fields will become automatically populated.


==== Project Setup
File > Open and select the folder containing the kicad source.
CLion may attempt to start CMake generation and fail, this is ok.

Open the Settings window again.
Navigate to Build, Execution, Development and then the CMake page.
These settings are saved to the project.

You want to create a Debug configuration as such

* Name: `Debug-MSYS2`
* Build-Type: `Debug`
* Toolchain: `MSYS2-MinGW64`
* CMake options:
----
-G "MinGW Makefiles"
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/mingw64
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw64
-DDEFAULT_INSTALL_PATH=/mingw64
----
* Build-directory: `build/debug-msys2`


You may now trigger the "Reload CMake Cache" option in CLion to generate the cmake project
You should delete the "junk" build folder (usually name cmake-build-debug-xxxx) it may have created in the source before it was changed above.
We change the build folder because we have a gitignore for `/build`

Warning: Receiving warning messages about Boost versions is normal.


=== Known MSYS2 Build Issues ## {#known_issues_msys2}

There are some known issues that are specific to MSYS2.  This section provides a list of the
currently known issues when building KiCad using MSYS2.

==== Building with Boost 1.70 ### {#ki_msys2_boost_1_70}

There is an issue building KiCad with Boost version 1.70 due to CMake not defining the proper
link libraries during configuration.  Boost 1.70 can be used but `-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON`
needs to be added during CMake configuration to insure the link libraries are properly generated.

==== Building OCE from source

KiCad requires OCE by default, and the version installed by `pacman` can cause build errors in
x86_64 systems as of March 2018.  In order to work around this, you can build OCE from source on
these systems.  Building OCE on Windows requires that you place the source code in a very short
directory path, otherwise you will run into errors caused by the maximum path length on Windows.
In the example below, the `MINGW-packages` repository is cloned to `/c/mwp`, which is equivalent to
`C:\mwp` in Windows path terminology.  You may wish to change the destination of the `git clone`
command if you do not want to place it on the root of your C drive, but if you run in to strange
compilation errors about missing files, it is probably because your path is too long.

[source,bash]
----
    git clone https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages /c/mwp
    cd /c/mwp/mingw-w64-oce
    makepkg-mingw -is
