== Development Tools

Before you begin building KiCad, there are a few tools required in addition to your compiler.
Some of these tools are required to build from source and some are optional.

=== CMake Build Configuration Tool

https://cmake.org[CMake] is the build configuration and makefile generation tool used by KiCad.  It is required.

[#git,reftext=Git]
=== Git Version Control System

The official source code repository is hosted on https://gitlab.com/[GitLab] and requires https://git-scm.com/[git] to get
the latest source. If you prefer to use https://github.com/[GitHub] there is a read only mirror of the official
KiCad repository. The previous official hosting location at https://launchpad.net/kicad/[Launchpad] is still active as
a mirror. Changes should be submitted as https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html[merge requests] via GitLab.  The development team
will not review changes submitted on GitHub or Launchpad as those platforms are mirrors only.

=== Doxygen Code Documentation Generator

The KiCad source code is documented using https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html[Doxygen] which parses the KiCad source code files
and builds a dependency tree along with the source documentation into HTML.  Doxygen is only
required if you are going to build the KiCad documentation.

=== SWIG Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator

http://www.swig.org/[SWIG] is used to generate the Python scripting language extensions for KiCad.  SWIG is not
required if you are not going to build the KiCad scripting extension.

== Library Dependencies

This section includes a list of library dependencies required to build KiCad.  It does not
include any dependencies of the libraries.  Please consult the library's documentation for any
additional dependencies.  Some of these libraries are optional depending on you build
configuration.  This is not a guide on how to install the library dependencies using you systems
package management tools or how to build the library from source.  Consult the appropriate
documentation to perform these tasks.

=== wxWidgets Cross Platform GUI Library

http://wxwidgets.org/[wxWidgets] is the graphical user interface (GUI) library used by KiCad.
As of version 7.0, KiCad is developed and tested against wxWidgets 3.2. The KiCad team will not
perform testing or bugfixing against older versions of wxWidgets, and may inadvertently introduce
changes that break compilation or function when building against older versions. We welcome patches
to fix build issues against earlier versions of wxWidgets as long as these patches do not change
functionality when compiling against more modern versions. These patches should be the minimum
necessary to get KiCad working, rather than attempting to backport functionality from the newer
wxWidgets API (unless doing so is trivial).

On macOS we use a custom fork of wxWidgets -- see the macOS build instructions for details.

=== Boost {cpp} Libraries

The https://www.boost.org/[Boost] {cpp} library version 1.71 or greater is required to build KiCad.

=== GLEW OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library

The http://glew.sourceforge.net/[OpenGL Extension Wrangler] is an OpenGL helper library used by the KiCad graphics
abstraction library (GAL) and is always required to build KiCad.

=== ZLib Library

The http://www.zlib.net/[ZLib] development library is used by KiCad to handle compressed 3d models (.stpz and .wrz files)
and is always required to build KiCad.

=== GLM OpenGL Mathematics Library

The http://glm.g-truc.net/[OpenGL Mathematics Library] is an OpenGL helper library used by the KiCad graphics
abstraction library (GAL) and is always required to build KiCad.

=== GLUT OpenGL Utility Toolkit Library

The https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/[OpenGL Utility Toolkit] is an OpenGL helper library used by the KiCad graphics
abstraction library (GAL)and is always required to build KiCad.

=== Cairo 2D Graphics Library

The http://cairographics.org/[Cairo] 2D graphics library is used as a fallback rendering canvas when OpenGL is not
available and is always required to build KiCad.

=== Python Programming Language

The https://www.python.org/[Python] programming language is used to provide scripting support to KiCad. It is always required to build KiCad.

=== wxPython Library

The http://wxpython.org/[wxPython] library is used to provide a scripting console for Pcbnew.  It needs to be
installed unless the <<wxPython scripting>> build configuration option is
disabled.  When building KiCad with wxPython support, make sure the version of the wxWidgets
library and the version of wxPython installed on your system are the same.  Mismatched versions
have been known to cause runtime issues.

=== Curl Multi-Protocol File Transfer Library

The http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/[Curl Multi-Protocol File Transfer Library] is used to provide secure internet
file transfer access for the Plugin and Content Manager.

[#libocct, reftext=OpenCascade]
=== OpenCascade Library

https://www.opencascade.com/content/overview[Open CASCSADE Technology (OCC)] is used to provide
support for loading and saving 3D model file formats such as STEP.  KiCad requires OCC 7.5.0 or
higher.  When building OCC locally, use the option BUILD_MODULE_Draw=OFF to make building easier

[#ngspice,reftext=Ngspice]
==== Ngspice Library

The https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/[Ngspice Library] is used to provide Spice simulation support in the schematic
editor.  Make sure the the version of ngspice library used was built with the--with-ngshared
option.  This library needs to be installed unless the Spice build option is disabled.

[#protobuf,reftext=Protobuf]
==== Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
The https://protobuf.dev/[protobuf] library is used to provide structured serialization of
KiCad data for the IPC API.  It is required even when the IPC API is not enabled, as it is
also used as part of QA testing and is likely to be used in other applications in the future.
KiCad requires protobuf version 3.x, and must be built with the same version of protobuf that
is deployed as a library on the target system.

[#nng,reftext=NNG]
==== Nanomsg Next Generation (nng)
The https://nng.nanomsg.org/[nng] library is used to provide a communications channel between
KiCad and third-party plugins and applications for the IPC API.  It is required when KICAD_IPC_API
is enabled.

== KiCad Build Configuration Options

KiCad has many build options that can be configured to build different options depending on
the availability of support for each option on a given platform.  This section documents
these options and their default values.

=== IPC API

The KICAD_IPC_API option is used to enable the experimental IPC API server.  When this option is
enabled, the <<nng>> library must be available.

[#wxpython_scripting,reftext=wxPython scripting]
=== wxPython Scripting Support

The KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON option is used to enable building the wxPython interface into
Pcbnew including the wxPython console. 

=== Integrated Spice simulator

The KICAD_SPICE option is used to control if the Spice simulator interface for Eeschema is
built.  When this option is enabled, it requires <<ngspice>> to be available as a shared
library.  This option is enabled by default.

=== STEP/IGES support for the 3D viewer

The KICAD_USE_OCC is used for the 3D viewer plugin to support STEP and IGES 3D models. Build tools
and plugins related to OpenCascade (OCC) are enabled with this option. When
enabled it requires <<libocct>> to be available.  This option is enabled by default.

=== Wayland EGL support

The KICAD_USE_EGL option switches the OpenGL backend from using X11 bindings to Wayland EGL bindings.
This option is only relevant on Linux when running wxWidgets 3.1.5+ with the EGL backend of
the wxGLCanvas (which is the default option, but can be disabled in the wxWidgets build).

By default, setting KICAD_USE_EGL will use a in-tree version of the GLEW library (that is compiled with
the additional flags needed to run on an EGL canvas) staticly linked into KiCad. If the system
version of GLEW supports EGL (it must be compiled with the GLEW_EGL flag), then it can be used instead
by setting KICAD_USE_BUNDLED_GLEW to OFF.

=== Windows HiDPI Support

The KICAD_WIN32_DPI_AWARE option makes the Windows manifest file for KiCad use a DPI aware version, which
tells Windows that KiCad wants Per Monitor V2 DPI awareness (requires Windows 10 version 1607 and later).

=== Development Analysis Tools

KiCad can be compiled with support for several features to aid in the catching and debugging of
runtime memory issues

==== Valgrind support

The KICAD_USE_VALGRIND option is used to enable Valgrind's stack annotation feature in the tool framework.
This provides the ability for Valgrind to trace memory allocations and accesses in the tool framework
and reduce the number of false positives reported. This option is disabled by default.

==== {cpp} standard library debugging

KiCad provides two options to enable debugging assertions contained in the GCC {cpp} standard library:
KICAD_STDLIB_DEBUG and KICAD_STDLIB_LIGHT_DEBUG. Both these options are disabled by default, and only
one should be turned on at a time with KICAD_STDLIB_DEBUG taking precedence.

The KICAD_STDLIB_LIGHT_DEBUG option enables the light-weight standard library assertions by passing
`_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS` into CXXFLAGS. This enables things such as bounds checking on strings, arrays
and vectors, as well as null pointer checks for smart pointers.

The KICAD_STDLIB_DEBUG option enables the full set of standard library assertions by passing
`_GLIBCXX_DEBUG` into CXXFLAGS. This enables full debugging support for the standard library.

==== Address Sanitizer support

The KICAD_SANITIZE_ADDRESS option enables https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html[Address
Sanitizer (ASan)] support to trace memory allocations and accesses to identify problems. This
option is disabled by default. The Address Sanitizer contains several runtime options to tailor its
behavior that are described in more detail in its
https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags[documentation].

Analogously, the KICAD_SANITIZE_THREADS option enables
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html[Thread Sanitizer (TSan)]. Its runtime options are
described https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags[here].

These options are not supported on all build systems, and are known to have problems when using
MinGW. They may also cause errors when using a linker other than the GNU linker, for example Gold,
Lld, Mold.

=== Demos and Examples

The KiCad source code includes some demos and examples to showcase the program. You can choose
whether install them or not with the KICAD_INSTALL_DEMOS option. You can also select where to
install them with the KICAD_DEMOS variable. On Linux the demos are installed in
$PREFIX/share/kicad/demos by default.

=== Quality assurance (QA) unit tests

The KICAD_BUILD_QA_TESTS option allows building unit tests binaries for quality assurance as part
of the default build. This option is enabled by default.

If this option is disabled, the QA binaries can still be built by manually specifying the target.
For example, with `make`:

* Build all QA binaries: `make qa_all`
* Build a specific test: `make qa_pcbnew`
* Build all unit tests: `make qa_all_tests`
* Build all test tool binaries: `make qa_all_tools`

For more information about testing KiCad, see [this page](testing.md).

=== KiCad Build Version

The KiCad version string is defined by the output of `git describe --dirty` when git is available
or the version string defined in CMakeModules/KiCadVersion.cmake with the value of
KICAD_VERSION_EXTRA appended to the former.  If the KICAD_VERSION_EXTRA variable is not defined,
it is not appended to the version string.  If the KICAD_VERSION_EXTRA  variable is defined it
is appended along with a leading '-' to the full version string as follows:

    (KICAD_VERSION[-KICAD_VERSION_EXTRA])

The build script automatically creates the version string information from the <<git>> repository
information as follows:

    (5.0.0-rc2-dev-100-g5a33f0960)
     |
     output of "git describe --dirty" if git is available.


=== KiCad Config Directory

The default KiCad configuration directory is `kicad`.  On Linux this is located at
`~/.config/kicad`, on MSW, this is `C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\kicad` and
on MacOS, this is `~/Library/Preferences/kicad`.  Inside the configuration directory,
subdirectories will be created for each KiCad minor version, meaning that multiple versions of
KiCad can share the same directory.

The base configuration directory can be overridden by specifying the KICAD_CONFIG_DIR string at
compile time.

NOTE: Setting KICAD_CONFIG_DIR should be considered deprecated as of KiCad 5.99, as the config
      directory is versioned and there should not be any need to set a custom directory.

=== Running from the Build Directory

Normally, KiCad needs to be installed before running in order to locate data files and shared
libraries.  Developers may be interested in running specific KiCad binaries from inside the build
directory instead of installing, as this can sometimes be a faster way to test things.  The
environment variable `KICAD_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIR` can be set in order to change how KiCad looks up
paths for shared libraries, resources, and other data files.  Note that setting this variable does
not change how KiCad looks for symbol/footprint/3D model libraries.

=== Setting the path to Python

KiCad relies on a specific Python version on Windows and macOS.  Normally, the path to this Python
installation is set by the corresponding packaging scripts for those platforms, but in some
situations, it can be preferable to set a custom Python interpreter for development or testing
purposes.  On Windows, you must set the environment variable `KICAD_USE_EXTERNAL_PYTHONHOME` in
order for KiCad to use the `PYTHONHOME` environment variable instead of the default (hard-coded)
path to Python.  This is so that `PYTHONHOME` set on user machines does not inadvertently break
KiCad.   See the Windows build instructions for details on how to use this variable to run KiCad
from the build directory.

== Getting the KiCad Source Code

There are several ways to get the KiCad source.  If you want to build the stable version you
can down load the source archive from the https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/[GitLab] repository.  Use tar or some
other archive program to extract the source on your system.  If you are using tar, use the
following command:

```sh
tar -xaf kicad_src_archive.tar.xz
```

If you are contributing directly to the KiCad project on GitLab, you can create a local
copy on your machine by using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad.git
```
