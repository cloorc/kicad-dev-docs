== API Documentation for Add-on Developers

The KiCad IPC API is a new feature in KiCad 9.0 that allows third-party applications to interact
with KiCad.  Unlike the SWIG-based Python bindings to KiCad's PCB editor, the IPC API is designed
to be a stable interface that does not change when KiCad's internals are refactored, and does not
require that KiCad build against Python directly.  It is also designed to be language-agnostic, so
that interoperability with software written in languages other than Python is possible.

=== API Status and Goals

The initial release of the IPC API in KiCad 9.0 is focused on a particular set of use cases that
will allow many (but not all) of the things that people have built using the SWIG-based Python
bindings to be done with the new API.  The API will be expanded over time (and, when practical,
additions will be backported to the 9.0 branch).

There are a few important limitations to be aware of when considering use of the IPC API:

1.  The IPC API currently only supports communication with a running instance of the KiCad GUI.
    There is no support for running KiCad in a headless mode, and unlike the SWIG-based Python
    bindings, the IPC API does not provide an independent way to load and process KiCad PCB files
    outside of the KiCad editor.  In the future, a headless mode (implemented through `kicad-cli`)
    will support third-party tools that want a way to interact with KiCad design files without
    running the full KiCad GUI.  Even then, third-party tools will need to launch `kicad-cli` and
    then communicate with it.  There are no plans to support a standalone library for loading and
    manipulating KiCad files separate from the client-server (IPC) model.

2.  The IPC API currently has no support for plotting or exporting files from KiCad designs.  This
    support may be added in the future, however the primary way we expect users to export files and
    generate other outputs from KiCad design files in an automated way is through the use of the
    `kicad-cli` tool.  If you are currently relying on Python scripting for generating outputs from
    KiCad, we recommend moving to `kicad-cli`.

In KiCad 9.0, the IPC API and the new IPC plugin system are only implemented in the PCB editor,
due to development time constraints.  In the future, the IPC API will be expanded to support the
schematic editor, library editors, and other parts of KiCad.  While there are specific places where
the IPC API has new features that are not available in the SWIG-based Python bindings, in general,
the capabilities of the IPC API in KiCad 9.0 should be seen as equivalent to the Action Plugins
system present since KiCad 5: a way to interact with a running KiCad PCB Editor session.

The API is still under active development, although after KiCad 9.0.0 is released, existing API
messages will be treated as stable and will be supported according to our deprecation policy. We
encourage developers to report issues and request new capabilities as they experiment with the API.

=== Connecting to KiCad

API clients such as scripts and plugins connect to KiCad using a Unix domain socket on macOS and
Linux, and a named pipe on Windows.  The socket or pipe is created by KiCad in the user's
temporary directory when KiCad is launched.  The name of the socket or pipe is `api.sock` by
default, but multiple instances of KiCad can be run simultaneously, and if this name is already
taken, KiCad will append its process id number (PID) to the name to make it unique.

When KiCad launches API plugins (see below), it will set several environment variables that can be
used by the client to know where to connect to the IPC API.  These variables include:

- `KICAD_API_SOCKET`: The full path to the socket or pipe that the client should connect to.
- `KICAD_API_TOKEN`: A generated token that the client should use in request messages.  This token
    is generally passed to the API client library when creating a connection to KiCad (for example,
    in the `__init__` method of a `KiCad` object in `kicad-python`).  This token is unique to the
    running instance of KiCad, and can be used by long-running clients to detect if KiCad restarts
    in the middle of a session.

API clients do not need to be launched from KiCad, but if they are not (for example, if a client is
launched from an IDE while developing a plugin), the client will not have access to these
environment variables.  For this reason, it is recommended that plugin developers run only one
instance of KiCad at a time while developing and testing plugins.

=== Plugin Action registration

IPC plugins can register actions that appear on the PCB editor's toolbar much like the SWIG-based
Action Plugins system.  There are several differences in how this is done, however:

1.  The default directory for IPC plugins is `${KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME}/<version>/plugins`, where
    `${KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME}` is the root path for KiCad's user data directory, which is
    platform-dependent.  On Windows, it is typically `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\KiCad`, on
    macOS it is typically `/Users/<username>/Documents/KiCad`, and on Linux it is typically
    `~/.local/share/KiCad`.
2.  Plugins must provide a `plugin.json` file containing metadata about the plugin and any actions
    it provides.  The `plugin.json` file must be in a subdirectory of the plugins directory, and
    must follow the link:https://go.kicad.org/api/schemas/v1[schema defined by KiCad].

The plugin system currently supports two types of plugins: Python-based, and executable.  Python
plugins are run by an external Python interpreter (unlike the SWIG-based plugins which run in an
interpreter embedded into KiCad), and KiCad will automatically manage the creation of a virtual
environment for each plugin using the chosen Python interpreter.  On macOS and Windows, KiCad will
continue to ship with its own Python interpreter, which will be used by the IPC system by default
if the user does not specify a different interpreter.  On Linux, KiCad uses the first version of
Python found in the user's PATH by default.  Executable plugins are run as separate processes with
an arbitrary command line, and can be used to launch plugins written in compiled languages, or any
other kind of external tool that does not require a Python environment.

=== Debugging

There are a few ways to get debug information from KiCad that might be useful while developing
against the IPC API, including trace output from KiCad as well as a log of all API requests and
responses.

To enable API-related trace output from KiCad itself (which is particularly useful for debugging
Python plugins that are being loaded by KiCad), set the following environment variables before
launching KiCad:

[source,sh]
----
KICAD_ALLOC_CONSOLE=1   # If you are on Windows, this variable is required to show any output
KICAD_ENABLE_WXTRACE=1  # This enables KiCad's tracing system even when running a release build
WXTRACE=KICAD_API       # This enables trace output for the API subsystem
----

To enable the API log file, create an advanced config file in your KiCad
link:https://docs.kicad.org/8.0/en/kicad/kicad.html#settings[configuration directory]
if you don't have one already (a plain text file named `kicad_advanced`), and add the following
line:

[source]
----
EnableAPILogging=1
----

This will create a file at `${KICAD_DOCUMENTS_HOME}/<version>/logs/api.log` containing every
API request and response at the Protobuf message level.

NOTE: The API log file can grow quite large, so be sure to disable it when you are done debugging.

=== Python Bindings

`link:https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad-python[kicad-python]` is the official Python bindings
library for the IPC API.  It is a wrapper around the Protobuf-based API that exposes Python
classes and helper methods that make it easier to interact with the IPC API from Python.

The `kicad-python` library is available on link:https://pypi.org/project/kicad-python/[PyPI].

Automatically-generated documentation for `kicad-python` is available online at
https://docs.kicad.org/kicad-python-main/.

There are some examples of scripts and plugins in the `examples` directory of the `kicad-python`
repository that may be a good starting point for developing your own tools.
