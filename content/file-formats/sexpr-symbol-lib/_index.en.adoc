.Summary The s-expression symbol library file format.
<!--more-->

== Introduction

This documents the s-expression symbol library file format for all versions of KiCad from 6.0.

* Symbol library files use the `.kicad_sym` extension.
* Symbol library files can only define one or more footprints.


== Layout

A symbol library file includes the following sections:

* <<_header_section,Header>>
* <<_symbol_section,Symbol Definition>>


== Header Section

The `kicad_symbol_lib` token indicates that it is KiCad symbol library file.  This section is
required.

NOTE: Third party scripts should not use `kicad_symbol_editor` as the generator identifier.
      Please use some other identifier so that bugs introduced by third party generators are
      not confused with a footprint library file created by KiCad.

```
(kicad_symbol_lib
  (version VERSION)                                             <1>
  (generator GENERATOR)                                         <2>

  ;; contents of the symbol library file...                     <3>
)
```

<1> The `version` token attribute defines the symbol library version using the YYYYMMDD date
    format.
<2> The `generator` token attribute defines the program used to write the file.
<3> The symbol definitions go here.  Symbol library files can have zero or more symbols.


== Symbol Section

The `symbol` token defines a symbol in the library.

```
  [SYMBOL_DEFINITION]                                        <1>
  ...
```

<1> The xref:../sexpr-intro/index.adoc#_symbols[SYMBOL_DEFINITION] defines the symbol(s) in the
    library file.
